Creator's Note: 
 
By doing this project, I started to understand what TOP was trying to teach in their Javascript Fundamentals courses. Before doing this, it was really hard for me to grasp the concepts being taught after I learned basic HTML and CSS. It was quite a big learning curve for me.

What I learned:
- Javascript Arrays 
- Functions and callbacks 
- Objects 
- Events 
- Variables 
- Loops 
- Conditionals 
- DOM Manipulation
